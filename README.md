<h1>Predicting Bulding Heating Load</h1>

This is part of the individual assignment for the unit QBUS2820.

The purpose of this report is to build an accurate predictive model for the variable HeatingLoad. This is done to help optimise the heating system operations. Being able to predict the total daily heating energy for a building will improve the energy efficiency in buildings, reduce costs and minimise environmental impact. The main dataset used for analysis in this report is ‘HeatingLoad training.csv’, this training dataset is used for modelling and choosing models.

The description of all variables:
- HeatingLoad: Total daily heating energy required (in kWh)
- BuidlingAge: Age of the building (in years)
- BuidlingHeight: Height of the buildings (in metres)
- Insulation: Insulation quality (1 = Good, 0 = Poor)
- AverageTemperature: Average daily temperature (in oC)
- SunlightExposure: Solar energy received per unit area (in W/m2)
- WindSpeed: Wind speed at the building’s location (in m/s)
- OccupancyRate: Proportion of the building that is occupied (%)
